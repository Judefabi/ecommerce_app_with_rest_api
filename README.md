    We have recently completed the transformation of [an ecommerce app](https://www.chupachap.co.ke) platform for ordering alcoholic drinks, from a WordPress website using WooCommerce to a React application, a move that will make it more robust and help the business owners to better manage their stock while improving the overall user experience.

The application allows users to shop, place their orders, and make payments via MPESA or on delivery.

## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/ecom_2.png)

We have recently completed the transformation of [an eccomerce app in Kenya](https://www.chupachap.co.ke) for ordering alcoholic drinks, from a WordPress website using WooCommerce to a React application, a move that will make it more robust and help the business owners to better manage their stock while improving the overall user experience. The application is built on top of a REST API and as the frontend developer for this role, I was tasked to replicate the existing [website design](https://www.chupachap.co.ke) and user experience in React. The application allows users to shop, place their orders, and make payments via MPESA or on delivery.

## Built With

The project is built using the following technologies:

- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
- [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)
- [MPESA Daraja API](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/)
- [Google Geolocation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/overview)

This projects is dynamic in that it can be customised via the backend depending on the products offered by the end user. the products, headers and images are fetched from the API allowing you to easily change this from an ecommerce app that sells drinks to a clothes shop as seen below.
